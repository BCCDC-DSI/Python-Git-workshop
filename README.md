# 2024-APR-05: Interactive workshop on Git & Python for Reproducible Research

## Workshop teaser

- To see how to recreate [a web app based on Streamlit](https://apr5-demo-app1.streamlit.app/) and more!

## Setup

### April 4th - prep session

- We will assist attendees with installing Anaconda3 and getting accounts for ```Streamlit``` and GitHub. 

### April 5th - main session

Please create an account for each of the following platforms depending on your personal goals:

| Accounts to obtain | Goals |
| :-- | :-- |
| Colab| ... if you would like to save your work done during the workshop |
| Colab, GitHub, Streamlit | ... if you would like to get the most out of the workshop |

Colab + Kaggle ***offer free Graphical Processing Units*** for your deep learning applications.

## Quick how-to

- **Windows users**, visit [Citrix PHSA login page](https://remoteapps.healthbc.org/logon/LogonPoint/tmindex.html) to download Anaconda3 (needed for creation of virtual environments) 
- **Mac users**, use terminal and simply copy-paste to install Git:
  ```
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  brew install git
  ```
